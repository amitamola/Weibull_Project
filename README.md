# Weibull_Project

### [Final paper](https://github.com/amitamola/Weibull_Project/blob/main/DataAnalalytics%20Wind%20Paper%20Final.pdf)


The folder **main_dir** contains the coding part related to this project. Here's the details related to the files inside:


### **Folders:**

1. **Data**: This folder contains the input datasets that have been used for analysis in Jupyter Notebooks. 

2. **final_outputs**: This folder contains the final outputs generated from the analysis in Jupyter Notebooks, saved as CSV files for different locations.

3. **Python files**: This folder contains all the Jupyter Notebooks converted into Python files(.py files).


### **Jupyter Notebooks:**

1. **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test between same season of different datasets.ipynb**: This notebook performs a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the same season of different datasets. The aim is to determine whether the same season of different datasets is significantly different or not.

2. **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for 5 to 21.ipynb**: This notebook performs a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between different seasons of the same dataset. The aim is to determine whether the different seasons of the same dataset are significantly different or not, from 5 to 21.

3. **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test within datasets between seasons.ipynb**: This notebook performs a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test within datasets between seasons. The aim is to determine whether the different seasons of the same dataset are significantly different or not.

4. **Project - Weibull Analysis - Dublin Airport.ipynb**: This notebook performs a Weibull analysis for the Dublin Airport dataset. The aim is to estimate the Weibull distribution parameters and generate the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots.

5. **Walkthrough - Weibull analysis for a dataset.ipynb**: This notebook provides a walkthrough of the Weibull analysis process for a given dataset. The aim is to help the user understand the Weibull analysis process and apply it to their own datasets.

6. **Weibull analysis for all_datasets.ipynb**: This notebook performs Weibull analysis for all datasets in the Data folder. The aim is to estimate the Weibull distribution parameters and generate the PDF and CDF plots for all datasets.


### **CSV files:**

1. **KS_test_between_same_season_different_datasets.csv**: This CSV file contains the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the same season of different datasets.

2. **KS_test_bw_locations_same_season_5to21.csv**: This CSV file contains the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between different seasons of the same dataset, from 5 to 21.

3. **KS_test_within_dataset_bw_seasons.csv**: This CSV file contains the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test within datasets between seasons.


### **Miscellaneous files:**

1. **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python packages and their versions required to run the Jupyter Notebooks.

2. **ridge_plot.py**: This Python file contains the code to generate the ridge plot, which is used in some of the Jupyter Notebooks.
